Revisor
===================

Revisor is an remotely-controlled lightweight browser mainly designed
for integration testing and automating tasks. It's based on
C++/Qt4/WebKit and is cross-platform, fast, and memory efficient
(well, at least it should be). Revisor was designed with minimalistic
approach in mind, so it aims to have less features and small codebase.

Revisor is **NOT** production-ready yet, but who cares? As developer,
you should definitely give him a try. And of course, Revisor is under
active development, so all your patches and suggestions are welcome.

Why Revisor is better?
----------

Or "Why Selenium sucks?" Because:

* It's lightweight and easy to use. You don't need to run Big Firefox
  with all it's unnecessary GUI and plugins.
* It allows to have completely separate "sessions" within one
  process. With Selenium you need to start as many Firefox instances,
  as many sessions you need.
* Revisor could be used from almost any environment, because it uses
  HTTP and JSON to communicate with clients.

Quick overview
----------

Revisor is a small HTTP server combined with small WebKit renderer. It
listens for HTTP commands and executes them. Commands are hashes
serialized to JSON. Responses are JSON too. You just create a command,
send it to Revisor and get response. Very simple. Obey.

Compilation
----------

You need Qt 4.6 and argtable2 to compile Revisor.

    $ sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev libargtable2-dev
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ qmake ../revisor_server.pro
    $ make
