Revisor
===================

Revisor is an remotely-controlled lightweight browser mainly designed
for integration testing and automating tasks. It's based on
C++/Qt4/WebKit and is cross-platform, fast, and memory efficient
(well, at least it should be). Revisor was designed with minimalistic
approach in mind, so it aims to have less features and small codebase.

Revisor is **NOT** production-ready yet, but who cares? As developer,
you should definitely give him a try. And of course, Revisor is under
active development, so all your patches and suggestions are welcome.
